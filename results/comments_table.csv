mxtved2,1lah7em,1lah7em,"**Rule 9.3** states that if a player receives Paid Items due to bugs, fraud, or other irregularities, they must report it to Wargaming.

I respectfully disagree that any violation occurred.

* I paid for the boxes using in-game gold I purchased with real money.
* I followed the publicly stated mechanics.
* There was no indication that receiving gold compensation for duplicate tanks, after completing the 10-tank list, was unintended or against any rule.
* There was no announcement, error message, or warning indicating a technical bug or abuse.
* If this was truly a technical issue, the responsibility lies with the event design, not with players who followed the rules.

Had I known that gold compensation would later be invalidated or considered a “bug,” I would not have invested in this event. I feel misled, and this undermines my trust in Wargaming.",AdSavings716,1,2025-06-15 00:19:37+00,2025-06-19 00:33:53.562808+00

mxt6vii,1lad4m2,mxr0qmr,"Have you ever thought about the fact that other game modes do not have multi tiered tanks in a platoon upon creation, but rather, all tanks are the same tier? There is(or at least used to) be a large amount of tanks in the files for that purpose, like the T-34-85 on tier 1 and such. 

It might seem minor, but coding does not work like that. Just because something is minor as a thought does not mean it's simple code.

The thing about WoT is that most things happen on the server. The physics, economy, penetration, rng, ground pressure, spotting, crew perks... all this happens on the server. And you do not want to mess with that, especially when the platoon system is closely connected to matchmaking and economy as well (you can guess about which part a multinational corporation cares about the most)

Not to mention that even a minor thing (such as a special type of texture) can literally cause the client going to shit. That's what delayed the first Mirny 13 event by a year.

There is a choice. 

You either have a game with a lot of ""hard coded"" things and boring restrictions with bugs that are in the grand scheme of things insignificant, 

or you have a game whose servers crash every day and has bugs that will actually cause the game to not work (most of the teams afk, tier 1s going against tier 10s in randoms, -1000000 credits after a win in a Pz. I C, ...), that will be basically unplayable.

Don't get me wrong, WG is a shitty corporation, but a multiplayer game with years of updates such as WoT is everything but simple code.

Of course, if you are a WoT developer with actual access to the whole code base, then touché, you are right, game can be just fixed with an if statement, and now go back to work on the September update.",gougim,0,2025-06-14 21:53:59+00,2025-06-19 00:33:53.562808+00
