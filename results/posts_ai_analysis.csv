1leuesb,Most effective method to turn BP tokens into Credits?,youngsyr,Discussion,"Hi all, I'm currently grinding a couple of Tier Xs for the next onslaught season and so will need 12m credits to eventually buy them.

I'm not really interested in any of the BP token tanks, so what's the best way to turn my 25 BP tokens into credits - is it to buy the AE Phase 1 for 12 tokens and sell it for credits 3.5m credits?

  
I know the Cobra can be sold for 3.5m credits and costs 28 tokens, so that's about 125k credits per token.

The Char futur 4 can also be sold for 3.5m credits and costs 18 tokens I think so that.s just under 200k credits per token.

1leqr1s,Accused of Cheating? Just explain your thought process and you might end up with a new ingame friend (Highway Edition),GlassAcanthocephala8,Gameplay Guide,"I for once had a post match chat, which had an unexpected happy end. Normally I don't care about people trash-talking after they had a disappointing game. We all have been there. But this very case I'd like to share, because maybe it gives some insight to players who are not familiar with figuring out where they are being spotted from or how view ports and visibility checkpoints work.

So after being accused of using aimbot, I explained to this guy how I could precisely tell where he was hiding and how I could one-shoot him blindly.

In general you expect enemy lights to sit in standard bushes. Every map has them, bushes that are prone to being shot at. On Highway (where the encounter with said gentleman happened), any light tank from north spawn has a good chance of spotting the entire heavy line when rushing to the likes of J8 or J7. With somewhat decent snipers in the back, you assist a lot of early damage. However, as a player from south spawn being spotted while driving to the city, you know there is a light sitting in J8 (mostly). In my case, I (FV4005) was spotted and decided to wait behind the little hill, covering me from the light AND from enemy TDs. However, arty kept shooting at me precisely. There was no way the light in J8 was still spotting me, so he must have been further down the street, but where?  
I then experimented a bit, hiding myself from different bushes along the street by driving up and down and re-exposing.  
Be aware, your first person view (gun view) is lower than your view port (where you spot other tanks and get spotted yourself). When peeking ridgelines, [your and the enemy's turret view port (highest physical point of each tank) will spot each other first](https://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Camo_and_Spotting#View_Range_Ports). That's why you spot enemies over ridgelines, before you can actually see them through your gun. Or alternatively, when you peek carefully and get spotted from a light, he's most likely in that one bush you just barely couldn't see yourself through your gun view.... does that make sense?  
Anyway, I was able to figure out exactly from what bush I got spotted from.  
I eventually kept driving up into the city, only to then slowly peek behind one of the houses using the slowest auto drive, preaiming the bush I figured the Manti was sitting in. Now obviously, he had like a minute to move or be ready to properly react to my peek.... but he decided not to move and eat 182.9mm of finest british HESH instead. Against all odds, he's my latest ingame friend now :D

1ldfh50,10 VS 10 random battles will fix blowouts.,ZeubeuWantsBeu,Discussion,"Turbo battles are a problem. Nobody likes getting rolled over in 5 minutes.

WG response is reworking maps to bigger sizes. Airfield, Ensk region, and soon: Mines (and part of Klondike). It's no coincidence that the smallest maps are getting reworked first. In combination with bigger maps, why not reduce team size? Simply getting shot less will result in living longer.

Here are my biggest arguments:

- Matchmaking is 33% faster.
- Faster MM = more time to spend on balancing.
- More balancing  = slower games.
- Mistakes won't kill you instantly.
- More open maps, more moving around

1lcwrwh,M48 and Cent AX,YamMaleficent8205,Discussion,"Yeah like the title said, but I won't do a comparison post cause we got plenty of that already. 

So I got both tanks and I love them so much, the play style is pretty much the same, hull down and let the accurate gun and gun depression doing the job for you, sometimes if RNG said you meant to lose the fight and the whole battle, then yes, you won't hit or even pen a god damn thing, every shot from the oppenents will go through your turret no matter the hell 254mm effective front armor mean sth.  

The M48 is slower, yes, but somehow, maybe it just me or the complicated feeling, bias yeah could be too. I feel like the M48 is easier to play, easier to control, easier to understand and be one with it. Got the Cent after it, enjoy everybit, but the feeling just isn't the same, no matter which one I play, I always go back to the M48. Anyone?

I was in a T29 on Westfield and I was on hill so I know for a fact only my turret was showing and thats where i got shot.
